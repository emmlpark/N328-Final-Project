    <h3>Design Process</h3>
    <p class="description">From the beginning I knew that I wanted to do a bar chart. For this type of data, it seemed to make the most sense.
        In the beginning, I didn't think that it would show different types of macros. The buttons were added later 
        on once I realized that it could show valuable information. At first, I wanted the bar chart to only 
        compare calories of the different cereals. Later on, I didn't feel like that provided very useful
        data. I selected protein, carbs, and fat as my three main focus points because those are the most common
        "macros" people focus on when looking at nutrition. Putting these three options as buttons came to my mind
        after I realized I could make this visualization a little more interactive. 
        Another step in my design process was the size of the figuring out how to label my axis. I knew that I wanted
        labels, but because the variables changed between 3 different attributes, I needed a universal way to label the 
        x and y axis. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Another big part of my design process was figuring out how many cereal brands to include. The original dataset included 80
        different cereal brands. At first I had imagined all 80 cereals would be on the chart. Down the line,
        that seemed like way too much to include in this visualization. So I narrowed it down to the top 10 cereals based on the 
        rating that was given in the dataset. This helped on saving space and making the visualization not as overwhelming.

    <h3>Rationale of Design Choices</h3>
    <p class="description">
        I wanted the colors of the chart to go with the color scheme of the rest of the website, so I chose something similar.
        I wanted it to be simple, so the colors did not change between the different macros, but that could be something that 
        I can update with the chart in the future. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For the title of the chart, I wanted it to stand out against the header of the page. I made sure to align the chart title to
        the left of the page, that way it is more in line with the chart and is separated from the header. I wish that I could have 
        figured out how to aling the axis titles differently. I don't like how they are not centered. But I think it is good
        that the x and y axis are labeled, just not as effective as it could be.  
        <br>
        <br>
        For the buttons to change which macro is being evaluated, I also wanted them to be in line with the title and the chart.
        They are standard buttons, so users should know how to use them without explaination. When the button is active, it is highlighted,
        so users know what action is about to take place. 
        <br>
        <br>
        One last major design choice was the size. The chart is very big and you have to make sure your browser is all the way open in order 
        to view it all. The main reason for this was due to the brand names. To fit all ten names on the chart in this format,
        the chart needed to be a bit bigger.

    <h3>Discovery</h3>
    <p class="description">
        The main question I wanted to answer with this visualization was "How do the macros of the top 10 rated cereals compare to each other?"
        Through this visualization, I was able to see what cereals have the most protien, fat, and suagr. This can help people 
        when making choices on which cereals can help with their health/dietary needs. 
        <br>
        <br>
        What I found most interesting out of this set of cereals was that only two cereals had any fat content. If you select the "Fat" 
        button, you will see that only 100% Bran and All-Bran had fat in them. The rest of the cereals have 0 fat. I would not have guessed this.
        Additionally with these two cereals, if you click the "Carbs" button, you will notice that these two cereals have the least amount 
        of carbs, with All-Bran having 7 grams of carbs and 100% Bran having 5 grams of carbs. This is not suprising considering food with higher
        fat content usually has less carbs. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Example of fat content in these two cereals:

        <p class="description">
            I think these charts are great for finding what cereals have the best macros to meet your health needs. Comparing through 
            a bar chart gives a great visual for how much of each macro is in every cereal. I think this tool could be helpful
            in answering these dietary questions.
